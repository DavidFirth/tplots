Description: A ternary plot is a standard display for 3-part compositional
  data.  A 'tetraplot' combines four ternary plots, in order to display a
  4-part composition.  In a tetraplot, each included ternary plot relates
  to one 3-part subcomposition.  Facilities of the 'grid' package are used
  here in order to produce ternary plots and tetraplots, inside square
  viewports.  The dataset that motivated this work, comprising vote counts
  at the 2024 UK General Election, is included in the package and is used
  as an example application of the plotting functions.
